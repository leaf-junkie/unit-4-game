In Gem Prospector, four gems, each with a random value, are displayed on the screen. The value of each gem is unknown to the player but can be determined by clicking the gems and doing some simple math. The goal of the game is to match your score to the goal. As long as the player's score is below the goal, they can continue clicking (or "prospecting"). If the player's score is above the goal, they lose, and the gem values and goal are reset.
